description: Why this book begins with language before mathematics.
---

Mathematics is a language, some might say.  
But for me it is a *beautiful and interconnected story* that **needs** a language
for public expression.  

Unlike music&nbsp;— which you can enjoy without ever seeing the notes on paper&nbsp;—
you **cannot** enjoy mathematics without knowing the language of its expression.

This little book aims to give you that language **without sacrificing the essence of mathematics itself**.
