Mathematics is a language, some might say.  
But for me it is a *beautiful and interconnected story* that **needs** a language  
for public expression. Unlike music—which you can enjoy without ever seeing the
notes on paper—you cannot enjoy mathematics without knowing the language in
which it is expressed.

This little book aims to give you *that* language **without sacrificing the
essence of mathematics itself**.  
My hope is that, page by page, you will come to

* **see** patterns with new eyes,  
* **say** what you see with precise symbols, and  
* **settle** the truth of those statements with compelling arguments.  

That journey begins in&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;0, where we practise looking,
speaking, and proving in their simplest forms.
