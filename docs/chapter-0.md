description: An opening primer on observation, expression, and proof.
---

Mathematics is a language, some might say.  
But for me it is a *beautiful and interconnected story* that **needs** a language for public expression.  
Unlike music — which you can enjoy without ever reading the notes — you **cannot** enjoy mathematics without knowing the language of its expression.  
This little book aims to give you that language **without sacrificing the essence of mathematics itself**.

## See it 👀

> *What do you see in the figure?*  
> Write it down.

Simply observing and jotting what we see is the first step, but sight alone can mislead us.  
Consider two triangles that *look* right-angled:

1. Sides 29-29-41  
2. Sides 3-4-5

Using the cosine formula we discover:

* The 29-29-41 triangle’s “right” angle is actually **89.97°** — *almost* but not quite 90 °.
* The 3-4-5 triangle is *exactly* right-angled and obeys the Pythagorean equation.

So vision must be checked by calculation.

## Say it 🗣️

Everyday language blurs relationships (“rain clouds ⇒ rain?”).  
In mathematics we must **state** connections precisely.  
For example, we will define exactly how a right triangle and the Pythagorean equation relate — converting intuition into explicit statements that can be tested.

## Settle it ✔️

Seeing and saying are not enough; we have to **settle** the truth.

Suppose measurements *seem* to show a 29-29-41 right triangle, yet the side lengths fail the Pythagorean check:

\[
29^2 + 29^2 \neq 41^2.
\]

Should we trust the ruler or the theorem?  
Measurement is always approximate; proof is exact.  
Throughout this book we’ll favour rigorous proof over unreliable sight or tools — and we’ll learn *how* to construct such proofs clearly and convincingly:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

### Take-away

1. **See it:** observe patterns, examples, figures.  
2. **Say it:** articulate relationships with unambiguous language.  
3. **Settle it:** prove (or disprove) using logical argument.

In the chapters ahead we’ll refine each skill — starting with the humble “If → Then” statement you just embedded!

> **Next:** Head to Chapter 1 where we formalise *If → Then* and experiment with a hands-on widget.
