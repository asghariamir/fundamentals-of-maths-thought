> *See it, say it, settle it.*

## 1 · Seeing 👀

What do you **see** in each figure below?  Write it down.

![29-29-41 triangle](/img/triangle-29-29-41.png)
![3-4-5 triangle](/img/triangle-3-4-5.png)

Both triangles *look* right-angled, yet only the second one **is**.
Using the cosine formula we find

* angle (29-29-41) ≈ 89.97° (almost but **not** 90°)  
* angle (3-4-5)   = 90°

Our naked eyes can be fooled; mathematics helps us look more deeply.

## 2 · Saying 🗣️

Observation is not enough—we must **express** relationships precisely.

### Two candidate statements

1. **If** a triangle is right-angled **then**  
   \(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\).  
   <span className="badge badge--secondary">Pythagoras’ Theorem</span>

2. **If** \(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\) **then**  
   the triangle is right-angled.  
   <span className="badge badge--secondary">Converse</span>

Both are true, but they play different roles when we reason about
triangles like 3-4-5 and 29-29-41.

## 3 · Settling ✔️

Seeing and saying still leave a question:

> **How do we know** what we think we know?

We *settle* by **proof**.

**Example · Disproving a “right” triangle by contradiction**

Assume the 29-29-41 triangle were right-angled.  
Pythagoras would then give \(29^{2}+29^{2}=41^{2}\),  
i.e. \(1682 = 1681\) — impossible.  
Hence the triangle is *not* right-angled.

Proof frees us from unreliable measurements.

## 4 · Tasks ✍️

1. Observe a familiar pattern and describe it in everyday words.  
2. Translate your description into algebraic symbols.  
3. Formulate a statement you could try to prove.
