> *See it, say it, settle it.*

## 1 · Seeing 👀

What do you **see** in each figure below?

![29-29-41 triangle](static/img/triangle-29-29-41.png)
![3-4-5 triangle](static/img/triangle-3-4-5.png)

Both triangles *look* right-angled, yet only the second one **is**.
Using the cosine formula we find  

* $\angle(29,29,41)\approx 89.97^{\circ}$ (almost but **not** $90^{\circ}$)  
* $\angle(3,4,5)=90^{\circ}$  

Our naked eyes can be fooled; mathematics lets us look more deeply.

## 2 · Saying 🗣️

Observation is not enough—we must **express** relationships precisely.

1. **If** a triangle is right-angled **then** $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$. <span class="badge badge--secondary">Pythagoras’ Theorem</span>  
2. **If** $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$ **then** the triangle is right-angled. <span class="badge badge--secondary">Converse</span>

## 3 · Settling ✔️

Assume the $29$–$29$–$41$ triangle were right-angled.  
Pythagoras would give $29^{2}+29^{2}=41^{2}$, i.e.\ $1682=1681$ — impossible.  
Hence the triangle is *not* right-angled.

## 4 · Tasks ✍️

1. Observe a familiar pattern and describe it in everyday words.  
2. Translate the description into algebraic symbols.  
3. Formulate a statement you could try to prove.
